 revision and the cloud 
NOTE: When git reset --hard is used, Git overwrites all changes in the working directory, permanently destroying any uncommitted changes.

When you use the git merge --no-ff command, instead of a branch simply moving its pointer forward, a new commit object is created.

Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.

To see which branches are already merged into the branch you’re on, you can run git branch --merged: To list available Git tags, use the git tag command: To save time and effort, one can create aliases for Git commands, which eliminates the need to type out an entire default Git command.

The above commands allow the user to simply type git br, git st, or git co, instead of git branch, git status, or git commit.



##So, what is Git in a nutshell? 
1 This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works,


- then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other **VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce —  **doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused.
